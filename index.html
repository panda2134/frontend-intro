      <h2>HTML5 Tags</h2>
      <p>
        Every single beginner loves copy-pasting HTML code from the web. I don't think that's wrong, actually.
        However, one should pay more attention to "where the code comes from".
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask your self several questions next time before pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> 's:
        <ol>
          <li>Is the code reviewed (if not recommended) by coding gurus?</li>
          <li>When was the code written? Frontend technologies evolves at lightning speed, and the code you found can be outdated.</li>
          <li>does it contain <i>depreciated</i> usage of APIs / HTML tags?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally speaking, I'm strongly against copying HTML code from some public blog site (especially Wordpress and CSDN).
        That's because experienced frontend engineers tend to run their own blog sites.
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> is a good place for green hands, since answers there are selected and edited by pros.
      </p>
      <p>
        For details about HTML5 tags, do not hesitate to refer to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
        Articles there are eagerly translated into dozens of languages (including Chinese) by volunteers, so language won't be a problem.
      </p>
      <h3>stop using div tags everywhere</h3>
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">MDN Docs</a> describe div as a generic container for flow content.
      In the years before HTML5, it had been used as a container for literally anything. However, this is not a good practice because HTML5 introduced content sectioning tags.
      
      Take a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning">those elements</a> on MDN.

        <h4>Try it yourself!</h4>

        Design a blog landing page. The page contains a header (with a h1 title inside), 2 articles and a footer (containing copyright notices, etc).
        <br>
        Note: articles should be wrapped by a <code>main</code> tag. You only need to code the parts inside <code>body</code> tag.

      <h2>Devtools</h2>
      In this section, I assume that you're using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
      The new Microsoft Edge also works in most cases, since it's a chromium-based browser.
      <h3>How to open</h3>

      <h3>Network tab</h3>
      When it comes to frontend, speed is the most important factor. Poorly designed webpages can take a minute to load, leading to awful user experience.
      There're too much to talk about when it comes to page speed optimization - we won't cover them today, because some tricks can be advanced.
      However, you can have a basic idea about such optimization by simply navigating to "network" tab.
